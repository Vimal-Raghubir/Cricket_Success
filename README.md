# My Cricket Companion

My Cricket Companion is a mobile application that helps a cricketer improve their performance. How does it do this? It does this by targeting the mental side of the game.

My Cricket Companion supports the creation and tracking of a cricketer's goals, creation of daily journals, tutorials curated from online cricket coaches, and a statistics section that allows a player to analyze their performance.

My Cricket Companion aims to be a central location for a cricketer to record all of their performances, strengths, weaknesses, goals, and areas of improvement.

Having all of this information written down allows the cricketer to focus on actually playing the game with a clearer purpose!
